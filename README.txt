This is a Python script that will automate the creation of a new project file and Git initialisation and first commit.
The end goal is to allow the script to automate the creation of your new GitHub repo and push your new project local repo onto it.

This script uses GitPython. Information and instructions of installing this can be found at: https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html
